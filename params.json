Don't expect it to be the nicest thing you have ever seen. There will also be the occasional heavily drunk commit which will break a lot of things only to be reverted/fixed the next day.\r\nRight now, my projects have very little documentation. I plan on fixing that soon, but you all fellow developers know how those things usually go, right? So, if you think any of my source code could be useful and you need some clarification, don't think twice about shooting me an e-mail.\r\nCurrently, the following projects are available: \r\n\r\n#### sins\r\nThis is a messaging queuing server focused on communication through websockets. It's based on the STOMP procotol, but I'm changing and adding new features whenever I think it makes more sense for websocket use cases. \r\n\r\n#### simple-webrtc-chat\r\nIf you are looking for a simple webrtc implementation ( for educational purposes ), this could be helpful. It uses my sins server to transport the signaling. The most simple use case can be found in the 'one-to-one' tag. Also, this being in heavy development, the master branch may not be working quite often. So that tag might be a good starting point.","google":"","tagline":"http://phow.at"}
